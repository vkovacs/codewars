Delta bits
---

Write a function convertBits to determine the number of bits required to convert positive integer A to positive integer B.

For example, you can change 31 to 14 by flipping the 4th and 0th bit:

~~~~
 31  0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1
 14  0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0
---  ---------------
bit  7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
~~~~
Thus 31 and 14 should return 2.
