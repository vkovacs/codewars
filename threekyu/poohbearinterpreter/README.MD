#Esoteric Language: 'Poohbear' Interpreter

Create a function that interprets code in the esoteric language 'Poohbear'
The Language

Poohbear is a stack-based language largely inspired by Brainfuck. It has a maximum integer value of 255, and 30,000 cells. The original intention of Poohbear was to be able to send messages that would, to most, be completely indecipherable: Poohbear Wiki

For the purposes of this kata, you will make a version of Poohbear that has infinite memory cells, meaning you do not need to limit cells to 30,000.

* Each cell can hold one byte of data. Once a cell's value goes above 255, it cycles back to 0. If a cell's value goes below 0, it cycles to 255.
* If the result of an operation isn't an int, round the result down to the nearest one.
* Your interpreter should ignore any non-command characters in the code.
* If you come to a 'W' in the code, while the current cell is equal to 0, skip past the corresponding 'E'.

Here are the Poohbear commands:
~~~
Command 	Definition
+ 	Add 1 to the current cell
- 	Subtract 1 from the current cell
> 	Move the cell pointer 1 space to the right
< 	Move the cell pointer 1 space to the left
c 	"Copy" the current cell
p 	Paste the "copied" cell into the current cell
W 	While loop - While the current cell is not equal to 0
E 	Closing character for loops
P 	Output the current cell's value as ascii
N 	Output the current cell's value as an integer
T 	Multiply the current cell by 2
Q 	Square the current cell
U 	Square root the current cell's value
L 	Add 2 to the current cell
I 	Subtract 2 from the current cell
V 	Divide the current cell by 2
A 	Add the copied value to the current cell's value
B 	Subtract the copied value from the current cell's value
Y 	Multiply the current cell's value by the copied value
D 	Divide the current cell's value by the copied value.
